          <h3>What is the Tech Radar?</h3>

          <p>
            The Schmiede Robotics Tech Radar is a list of technologies,
            complemented by an assessment result, called
            <em>ring assignment</em>. We use four rings with the following
            semantics:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>ADOPT</strong> &mdash; Technologies we have high
              confidence in to serve our purpose, also in large scale.
              Technologies with a usage culture in our team in production
              environment, low risk and recommended to be widely used.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>TRIAL</strong> &mdash; Technologies that we have seen work
              with success in project work to solve a real problem; first
              serious usage experience that confirm benefits and can uncover
              limitations. TRIAL technologies are slightly more risky; some
              engineers in our organization walked this path and will share
              knowledge and experiences.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>ASSESS</strong> &mdash; Technologies that are promising
              and have clear potential value-add for us; technologies worth to
              invest some research and prototyping efforts in to see if it has
              impact. ASSESS technologies have higher risks; they are often
              brand new and highly unproven in our organisation. You will find
              some engineers that have knowledge in the technology and promote
              it, you may even find teams that have started a prototyping
              effort.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>HOLD</strong> &mdash; Technologies not recommended to be
              used for new projects. Technologies that we think are not (yet)
              worth to (further) invest in. HOLD technologies should not be used
              for new projects, but usually can be continued for existing
              projects.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>What is the purpose?</h3>

          <p>
            The Tech Radar is a tool to inspire and support all team members in
            the Digiteam to pick the best technologies and tools for new
            projects; it provides a platform to share knowledge and experience
            in technologies, to reflect on technology decisions and continuously
            evolve our technology landscape. Based on the
            <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar"
              >pioneering work of ThoughtWorks</a
            >, our Tech Radar sets out the changes in technologies that are
            interesting in software development &mdash; changes that we think
            our team should pay attention to and use in its projects.
          </p>

          <h3>How do we maintain it?</h3>

          <p>
            The Tech Radar is maintained by our
            <em>Senior Engineers</em> &mdash; who facilitate and drive the
            technology selection discussions in the Digiteam across the
            Engineering Community. Assignment of technologies to rings is the
            outcome of ring change proposals, which are discussed and voted on.
            The Tech Radar is open for contribution for all teams at DCJ and
            depends on their active participation to share lessons learned,
            pitfalls, and contribute to good practices on using the
            technologies.<br />
